Abstract:

The Snake Game is a browser-based game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The objective of the game is to control a snake that moves around the board, eats food to grow longer, and avoids colliding with the walls or itself. 
This project demonstrates fundamental concepts of web development such as canvas drawing, event handling, DOM manipulation, and basic game loop implementation.
It serves as a beginner-friendly introduction to interactive game development using JavaScript.

Structure of the Project:

The project is organized into separate files to maintain clarity and modularity.

File Description


index.html - Defines the structure of the game. It contains the canvas, score display, and game-over screen

CSS/style.css - Styles the game layout and UI. It centers the board and controls visibility of elements

JS/script.js - Contains the complete game logic. It handles snake movement, food generation, scoring, collision detection, and game state

README.md -Providing the documentation and explanation of the project. 

How to Open and Run the Game in VS Code

1.Install Visual Studio Code
2. After installing VS Code,  Click File → Open Folder → select the folder that contains the Snake Game files
3. Open index.html in VS Code (you can view it through browser extension)
4. Play the game using arrow keys to move the snake up, down, left and right. The game ends whenthe snake hits the wall or collides with itself.
5. When the Game Over message appears, the final score is displayed. Clicking Try Again reloads the game.

Learning Outcomes :

This project helped me understand canvas drawing, keyboard events, and how game logic works using JavaScript.
